## Hi there, I'm Cleo 👋

I'm in my final year of CS at Adelaide University, with experience in full-stack development (including robotics work), blue teaming and machine learning. I've primarily developed in C++ alongside a mix of other languages (e.g. Python, Java) - I love finding new areas to dig into and see what I can hack together.
