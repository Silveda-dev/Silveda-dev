## Hi there, I'm Cleo ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second year computer science student at the University of Adelaide with passions for cybersecurity and full stack development.

I'm particularly interested in digital forensics and incident response â€” in fact, I'm ranked in the top 40 out of 25,000+ global users on [KC7Cyber](https://kc7cyber.com/leaderboard), a site simulating cyberattacks from a SOC analyst's perspective. I've also participated in a range of CTFs and cryptography challenges.

As a developer, I prioritise creating unique, robust applications with an emphasis on creative, user-friendly design. The majority of my programming experience is in C++, Python and JavaScript.
